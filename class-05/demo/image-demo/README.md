Image types:
    - .jpg: great for general use
            - compressed 
            - loses some detail
    - .png: great for logos/screenshots/high accuracy/transparency layer
            - lossless
            - bigger file size
            - does not lose detail
            - can have a transparent layer
    - .svg: also great for logos, simple graphics/designs that can scale up
            - can't replace a picture
            - can also have transparent background layer
            - vector definition of how to "draw" a file, with math
            - ie the curves, lines, and color fill of the google logo
            - the benefit is that it can be scaled to any size without loss of detail
    - .gif: animated picture file
